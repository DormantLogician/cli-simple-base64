### Description
The 'Letter' class within sb64 might be usable in other projects in order to implement other base 64 encoder and/or decoders because it implements the methods needed to manipulate bits for base 64 interpretation.

- Change visibility of 'concat_bits' to private.
- Move Letter class out of detail namespace.
